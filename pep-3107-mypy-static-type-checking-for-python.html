<h2>Dynamic vs. Static typing</h2>
<p>Sometimes, people discuss if static or dynamic typing is better. In my experience from my
<a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/users/mgmechanics">own projects</a>,
done in two different type systems Python (dynamic typing) and, Java (static typing),
I found that effective programming is done best using both.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I use the <strong>static type system</strong> when modelling with classes. Any class represents an real-world object.</div>
<div class="line">For example, each employee of a company has an id: employee_id</div>
<div class="line">Each room where the company has its registered office also has an id: room_id</div>
<div class="line">Now think of a function which keeps track between employees and rooms like this:</div>
<div class="line">Peter -&gt; R4711</div>
<div class="line">Hans -&gt; R4711</div>
<div class="line">Alice -&gt; R4710</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">In real-world, think of ids as 8-digit numbers so you can't decide if it is an employee or a room:</div>
<div class="line">1111.1111 -&gt; 1111.1113</div>
<div class="line">1111.1112 -&gt; 1111.1114</div>
<div class="line">2000.3000 -&gt; 3000.2000</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>Of course, tests should still reveal if we would link two rooms or two employees to each other.
But static type checking can do a lot for me: At least inside of a project,
I can make sure that I always use the function as intended before giving it to the test.
Finding errors only reduces the costs! (I use Python3 with PEP 3107 annotations for this example).</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class EmployeeId:
    def __init__(self, id):
        self.id = id

class RoomId:
    def __init__(self, id):
        self.id = id

def place_employee(employee_id: EmployeeId, room_id: RoomId) -&gt; None:
    pass
</pre>
<p>In this example I want to use any object as id itself.
Of course I could do with static typing i.e. by using generic typing (as in Java).
But this a job I give to <strong>dynamic typing</strong>. So I save the effort for bothering with generics.
Generics can really cause headaches!</p>
<p>Back to the example above: I don't need to give up any safety.
I would use a factory function which produces employee_ids and room_ids.
Then I can control which objects are used as an id on a single point. This seems good enough for me.</p>
<p>Other things where dynamic typing reduces the effort seems everything but modelling using classes.
I never want to write a GUI using static typing - the effort can kill. I'm thinking about re-writing
a library for automatic GUI testing (called <a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/awtomat/">Awtomat</a>
because I need heavy use of Java Generics but don't need the type system because
when I'm just want to send a mouse click to any object I just want to do this what ever it is.</p>
<p>Also I would use dynamic typing for importing and exporting data: When I need an object as string I
do not care what it is. If I put a string from employee_id in a field meant for room_ids artful
testing will reveal it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-choose-between-dynamic-and-static-typing">
<h2>Why choose between dynamic and static typing?</h2>
<p>Until I discovered <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a> I would need to do my projects like
<a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jdecisiontable">JDecisiontable</a> in two languages:</p>
<p>1. pure Java for a library handling the domain-specific data and (business-)methods which relies heavily
on static typing as shown in the example above (bundled in an own project like
<a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jdtlib">JDecisiontableLib</a></p>
<p>2. a dynamic language for writing the GUI, data im- and export and system tests;
this would be done in a project like JDecisiontable which provides merely a GUI around the core
of the application, JDecisiontableLib.</p>

<div class="section" id="using-only-python-thanks-to-pep-3107-and-mypy">
<h2>Using only Python thanks to PEP 3107 and mypy!</h2>
<p>Thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/">PEP 3107 'Function Annotations'</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a> I can write all code in Python!</p>
<p><strong>PEP 3107</strong> is a standard for Python which let us add some useful information to our python code,
so-called Function Annotations.</p>
<p><strong>mypy</strong> is a library/tool which uses these Function Annotations to provide type checking.
The Python code altered such will run as usual. You don't need a special Python interpreter!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="trying-mypy">
<h2>Trying mypy</h2>
<p>The README.md file in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JukkaL/mypy">github repository for mypy</a> tells how to install mypy.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>I setted up a virtual Python3 environment in a folder named <strong>test/venv_for_mypy/</strong></li>
<li>I checked out the source code of mypy from the github repository in a folder named <strong>test/mypy/</strong></li>
<li>I changed into test/mypy</li>
<li>I executed <strong>../venv_for_mypy/bin/python setup.py install</strong> to install mypy in the virtual environment, so we don't need to change our system (and need no sudo)</li>
<li>I created a simple Python script containing example code from mypy, <strong>test/fibtest.py</strong></li>
<li>I changed back into folder <strong>test</strong></li>
<li>Now I can use mypy to check fibtest.py: <strong>./venv_for_mypy/bin/python mypy/scripts/mypy fibtest.py</strong></li>
</ol>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">This step wasn't easy to figure out how! If this would be my project you could run it just like</div>
<div class="line"><strong>./venv_for_mypy/bin/python mypy fibtest.py</strong>!</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>The path <strong>./venv_for_mypy/bin/python</strong> calls the python interpreter from the virtual environment rather that one from you system.
That one from your system wouldn't be useful because mypy isn't installed there.</p>
<p>Given a fibtest.py like this it mourns:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
from typing import Iterator

def fib(n: int) -&gt; Iterator[int]:
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a &lt; n:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a+b

[print(fib) for fib in fib(12)]
</pre>
<pre class="literal-block">
fibtest.py, line 9: &quot;print&quot; does not return a value
</pre>
<p>Running it from folder test fibtest.py give us:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
./venv_for_mypy/bin/python fibtest.py
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
</pre>
<p>Let's make fibtest.py defective:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
from typing import Iterator
# should return Iterator[int]
def fib(n: int) -&gt; Iterator[str]:
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a &lt; n:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a+b

[print(fib) for fib in fib(12)]
</pre>
<p>Now it returns two messages:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
fibtest.py: In function &quot;fib&quot;:
fibtest.py, line 6: Incompatible types in yield (actual type &quot;int&quot;, expected type &quot;str&quot;)
fibtest.py: At top level:
fibtest.py, line 9: &quot;print&quot; does not return a value
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-will-pep-3107-mypy-give-to-me">
<h2>What will PEP 3107 + mypy give to me</h2>
<p>PEP 3107 + mypy takes away the need to use another language than Python to use static type checking.
Now I can write everything in Python.</p>
<p>Moreover, I can mix static type checking with dynamic typing even for a single function (see first example).</p>
<p>I am no longer forced to use the Java ecosystem just because the core of my application needs static
type checking. I see this on background that - as far as I know - Oracle Java for Microsoft(R) Windows(R)
operation system is still installing browser plug-ins as of time of writing. (Although I prefer proudly
Free Software, the (potential) users of my software often are not.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-pep-3107-mypy-will-not-give">
<h2>What PEP 3107 + mypy will not give</h2>
<p>I used the term &quot;type checking&quot;. This is not the same as &quot;typing&quot;. Neither PEP 3107 nor mypy will
give us static typing for Python. I don't miss it.</p>
